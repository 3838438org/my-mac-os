# [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)
You can read about how I use the app in a lot of detail in [my wiki](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/macOS/apps/BetterTouchTool.html).

Here you can find the PDF file with all the custom gestures and mappings I have made together with a downloadable .JSON that you can import to your BetterTouchTool to get all the hotkeys and gestures I setup for myself.
