# My Typinator Sets 
I wrote about how I use [Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/) and [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) together to automate writing in an article you can read [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/write-once-never-write-again-c2fa1f6c4e8).

Here you can find the different Sets that I use from Typinator to speed up my writing.

The Sets can be found in [this folder](./sets) and here is their explanation. 

1. Word expand
	- contains single word expansions of words with more than 5-6 characters
2. Fantastical
	- contains expansions for easing entering of natural input in [Fantastical app](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
	- more information on this Set can be found in [this article](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr)
3. corrections 
	- contains simple corrections like expanding 'eg ' to 'e.g.'
